Yes, this is extremely useful, and here is why:

Most budgeting apps are passive—they just tell you what you already spent (like a rearview mirror). This Financial Flow feature, powered by AI, turns your app into an active financial planner (like a GPS).

Why the AI features make it powerful:
🧠 Eliminates "Decision Fatigue" (Smart Classifier)
The Problem: Categorizing every transaction as "Need" vs "Want" is tedious. Most users quit after 2 weeks.
The AI Fix: It does it for you. It knows that Supermarket is usually a "Need" but Cinema is a "Want". This gives you instant, effortless insight into your lifestyle costs.
🔮 Prevents "Surprise Bills" (Predictive Needs)
The Problem: People often set a static budget (e.g., "₹20k for bills"), but bills fluctuate (AC in summer, gifts in festive seasons).
The AI Fix: The AI looks at history and predicts, "Next month your fixed needs will be higher (₹25k)." This prevents you from overspending your surplus before bills are paid.
🚀 Maximizes Wealth (Dynamic Allocator)
The Problem: A fixed 50/50 savings rule is rigid. On a low-expense month, you could save 80%, but you might just spend the extra because "the rule said 50%".
The AI Fix: The AI nudges you: "You have a low-expense month! I suggest saving 70% of your surplus to hit your Vacation Goal 2 months early." It pushes you to optimize when possible.
In short: It moves the user from "Where did my money go?" to "This is exactly how much I can safely spend today."

Shall I proceed with implementing this AI-Powered Financial Flow system? I'm ready to start with the database changes.
